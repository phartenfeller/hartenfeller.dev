## What is this?

Type `apex` in your Alfred search bar, and you will get a list of useful links and tools for your Oracle APEX development:

<BlogImg
  filename="alfred-apex-overview.png"
  alt="Typing apex into the spotlight reveals several submenus like Documentation, Icons, CSS, Views, and more."
  maxWidthPx="700"
/>

You can select a category with the arrow keys and enter, and then start typing to filter the results:

<BlogGif
  filename="alfred-apex-full-demo.gif"
  alt="In this video the user types 'apex', then select the documentation category and types 'mail'. The results show entries related to the 'APEX_MAIL' package. Upon selecting one a browser window opens with the documentation page."
/>

For resources with a URL, your browser will open the page directly. For others, like the CSS classes, icons, view names, etc. the result will be typed out. **If you have no focused input, nothing will happen.**
