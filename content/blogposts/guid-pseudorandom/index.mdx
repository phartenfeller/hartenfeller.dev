I recently thought about about [the awesome blogpost by Ois√≠n Moran on how he managed to create a self-referencing tweet](https://oisinmoran.com/quinetweet). He basicly looked into Tweet-ID generation and managed to predict the ID his tweet would get and placed a link to this tweet in the tweet itself.

## Copypasta

ffmpeg -i http203-view-transitions.mp4 -vf "select=eq(n,0)" -q:v 3 output_image.jpg

<InfoBox>
  The "apex.items.#ITEM_NAME#" syntax exists since "21.2". In prior versions you
  have to call it the following way: "apex.item('#ITEM_NAME#')".

## Another trivia with random URLs

YouTube video URLs are also randomly generated. This will of course lead to funny coincidences like [this bike related video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrADb-DCMyg) starting with `OraDB` or this [awesome party with drummers recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QUerY-cn-iU) starting with `query`. The casing is different but still in the huge amount of videos Google indexed only one video starting with query in the ID.

You can find them by using this Google query:

````
allinurl:v=query site:youtube.com/watch
```
````
