## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a cool yearly programming challenge.
Each day from 1st to 25th December a new challenge appears.
You can solve it in any programming language you like.
After [deepening my Go skills last year](https://github.com/phartenfeller/advent-of-code-2021)

I will do this in Oracle (so PL/SQL and SQL) this year.
I try to blog about my solutions but I won't make it every day or give up after a while as they get more difficult and time-consuming.
You can find my solutions for this year in [this repository](https://github.com/phartenfeller/advent-of-code-2022).

I really suggest you check Advent of Code out yourself as it is a lot of fun and you will improve your problem-solving skills.

The challenges are clearly phrased with a simple example you can do in your head.
You then get a way bigger generated and **user-specific** input and have to solve the challenge with that.
You have to enter a solution in an input field and get a star for each day you solved.
There is also a second challenge every day where you have to adapt some part of your algorithm to solve it.

## Challenge 1

[You can read the challenge yourself here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/1).

We get a user input that consists of numbers and line breaks:

```txt
1000
2000
3000

4000

5000
6000

7000
8000
9000

10000
```

The numbers represent the calories of a single food item an elf has.
A completely empty line states that the data for the next elf starts.
So the first elf has 1000, 2000, and 3000 calories, and the second elf has 4000 calories.

We must find out how many calories the elf with the most calories has.

## Solving challenge 1

We need to store the data.
So let's first create a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE elf_calories (
  id           NUMBER,
  calories     NUMBER,
  constraint elf_pk primary key (id)
)
INMEMORY;
```

The input I received has over 2000 lines. So I must find a way to programmatically get the data into the table.

First off I wanted to group the data by single elves and then add up the single calories.
So I first split the line by **two** line breaks and then split the resulting lines by **a single** line break.
For that I use `apex_string.split` to get an <Link to="/blog/ode-to-apex-t-varchar2">apex_t_varchar2 array</Link>.

Afterward, we can just sum up the calories for each elf and then store the result in the table:

```sql
declare
  l_input varchar2(32767 char) := q'!6471
1935
1793
...
...
...
16077

6030
1807!';

  l_elves        apex_t_varchar2;
  l_elf_str      varchar2(2000 char);
  l_elf_calories apex_t_varchar2;

  l_cal_sum      pls_integer;
  l_single_cal   pls_integer;
begin
  -- split input by two LFs -> array for every elf
  l_elves := apex_string.split(l_input, apex_application.LF || apex_application.LF );
  dbms_output.put_line('Elf count: ' || l_elves.count);

  for i in 1..l_elves.count
  loop
    l_cal_sum := 0;
    l_elf_str := l_elves(i);
    l_elf_calories := apex_string.split(l_elf_str, apex_application.LF);

    for j in 1..l_elf_calories.count
    loop
      -- convert single cal string to number
      l_single_cal := to_number(l_elf_calories(j));
      l_cal_sum := l_cal_sum + l_single_cal;
    end loop;

    -- insert sum of calories into table
    insert into elf_calories values(i, l_cal_sum);
  end loop;

end;
/
```

To get the result we just need to query the data for the maximum calories:

```sql
prompt Most calories:
select *
  from elf_calories
 where calories = (select max(calories) from elf_calories)
;

```

Et voil√†, we get our result. Check out the [full solution here](https://github.com/phartenfeller/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/src/01/1.sql).

## Challenge 2

For challenge two we have to get the sum of calories for the 3 elves that have the most calories.

## Solving challenge 2

This part is super easy when we have access to SQL so we just need to add a small query. With the [rank analytic function](https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/rank-dense-rank-first-last-analytic-functions#rank) we can get a sequential order (ranking) for a custom order or even with groups. We just rank the calories column in descending order:

```sql
prompt Top Three elves sum:
with rank_data as (
select id, calories, rank() over (order by calories desc)  as cal_rank
  from elf_calories
)
 select sum(calories)
   from rank_data
  where cal_rank between 1 and 3
;
```

Check out the [full solution here](https://github.com/phartenfeller/advent-of-code-2022/blob/main/src/01/2.sql).

## Conclusion

This was a fairly easy challenge so let's see what the next days will bring.

If you have a different approach or have some optimizations for my solution, please let me know!
