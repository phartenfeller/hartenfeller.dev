I am proud to share my first public Oracle APEX Plug-In. You can download it on [GitHub](https://github.com/phartenfeller/apex-slide-over-plugin).

The Demo is avaiable [here](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/hartenfeller_dev/r/slide-over-plugin-demo/slideover-demo).

The Slideover Plug-In is a region Plug-In that is by default hidden and slides in from the side when opened. It can slide in from both sides and uses the user-configured Universal Theme styles for APEX Version 21.1. The minimum APEX version to use this Plug-In is 19.2. For more details take a look at the [GitHub Page](https://github.com/phartenfeller/apex-slide-over-plugin).

## How to use

- Create a region of the type "Slideover [Plug-In]"
- Change Layout -> Position to "Body1"
- Put your desired child regions into the created Plug-In region
- Change settings under the region attributes (optional)

To open the region create a Dynamic Action with the "Action Open". Then select the Plug-In region.

Or with JavaScript:

```js
apex.region('regionStaticID').open();
apex.region('regionStaticID').close();
```
