## Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a great yearly programming challenge.
Each day (1st to 25th December) a new challenge appears that challenges your and problem solving and programming skills.
I learn a lot every year and it is a lot of fun.

I will do the challenges in Oracle (SQL and where necessary PL/SQL) this year again. You can find my solutions in [this repository](https://github.com/phartenfeller/advent-of-code-2023) and if I find the time on this blog.

I really **recommend checking Advent of Code out yourself** before reading on.
The challenges are clearly and in a christmas theme.
There is alawys a small sample input to test your solution and a bigger input to get the real result.
When solving the first challenge you get a star and a second more difficult challenge appears.

## My setup

I am doing the challenges on a local 23c free edition database. I want to explore some of the new features of 23 so some of the syntax might not work on older versions. I also will use the Oracle APEX API packages.

I import the input data into a table that stores each line of the input as a row.

```sql
create table aoc_input (
  day      integer             not null -- 1-25
, key      varchar2(255 char)  not null -- 'SAMPLE1', 'INPUT' etc.
, line_no  integer             not null -- 1, 2, 3, ...
, line_str varchar2(4000 char) not null -- The actual line
, constraint aoc_input_pk primary key (day, key, line_no)
);
```

I then use SQL Developer to import the input data into the table. I use a bind for the input and paste the data from the website:

```sql
begin
  insert into aoc_input
    (day, key, line_no, line_str)
  with x as (
    select :bind as data from dual
  )
  select 1
       , 'INPUT' -- or something like 'SAMPLE1'
       , rownum
       , column_value
    from x
       , apex_string.split(x.data, chr(10));

  commit;
end;
/
```

## Day 1

[You can read the challenge text here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1).

### Star 1

We can start by removing all non-numeric characters from the lines:

```sql
select line_no
       -- remove all non numeric characters
     , regexp_replace(line_str, '[^0-9]', '') as line
  from aoc_input
 where day = 1
   and key = '1'
 order by line_no
;
/*
   LINE_NO LINE
__________ _______
         1 9
         2 1
         3 37
         4 38
         5 38
*/
```

Next we need to extract the first and last digit of each line. We can just use `substr` for that. With `1` we get the first and with `-1` the last character. Additionally we need concat both chars and convert the result to a number:

```sql
with only_nums as (
  select line_no
         -- remove all non numeric characters
       , regexp_replace(line_str, '[^0-9]', '') as line
    from aoc_input
   where day = 1
     and key = '1'
   order by line_no
)
select line_no
       -- concat first and last character, convert res to number
     , to_number(substr(line, 1, 1) || substr(line, -1, 1)) as row_res
  from only_nums
;
/*
   LINE_NO    ROW_RES
__________ __________
         1         99
         2         11
         3         37
         4         38
         5         38
*/
```

At last we only need to sum up all the results:

```sql
with only_nums as (
  select line_no
         -- remove all non numeric characters
       , regexp_replace(line_str, '[^0-9]', '') as line
    from aoc_input
   where day = 1
     and key = '1'
   order by line_no
), row_res as (
  select line_no
         -- concat first and last character, convert res to number
       , to_number(substr(line, 1, 1) || substr(line, -1, 1)) as row_res
    from only_nums
)
-- sum up all row results
select sum(row_res) from row_res
;
```

### Star 2

I really struggled with this one. We need to convert the words of digits like `one` to the actual number `1`. At first I thought a simple `replace` would do the trick. But this does not work as `eighthree` should actually be converted to `83`. With the the replace approach we would replace the shared `t` and thus the second replace would not work (e.g. `8hree`).

I was already at the end of my SQL skills and thought only PL/SQL can solve this. So I created a function that loops over each char of the input and looks if there is a digit. If this is true i append the digit to a result string otherwise I append the char itself. This works but is not very elegant.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION day1_replace_digits(pi_str VARCHAR2) RETURN VARCHAR2 IS
    l_temp_str   VARCHAR2(4000);
    l_replaced_str VARCHAR2(4000) := '';
BEGIN
    dbms_output.put_line(pi_str);
    for i in 1 .. length(pi_str)
    loop
      l_temp_str := substr(pi_str, i);

      case
        when l_temp_str like 'one%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '1';
        when l_temp_str like 'two%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '2';
        when l_temp_str like 'three%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '3';
        when l_temp_str like 'four%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '4';
        when l_temp_str like 'five%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '5';
        when l_temp_str like 'six%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '6';
        when l_temp_str like 'seven%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '7';
        when l_temp_str like 'eight%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '8';
        when l_temp_str like 'nine%' then
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || '9';
        else
          l_replaced_str := l_replaced_str || substr(pi_str, i, 1);
      end case;

    end loop;

    dbms_output.put_line(l_replaced_str);
    RETURN l_replaced_str;
END day1_replace_digits;
/


-- Example
-- Input:  four5djlmjfive99eightonefour
-- Output: 4our5djlmj5ive998ight1ne4our
```

We can now apply the same logic as in star 1 to get our result:

```sql
with digit_str as (
  select line_no
       , day1_replace_digits(line_str) as line_str
       , line_str as orig
    from aoc_input
   where day = 1
     and key = '1'
), only_nums as (
  select line_no
         --remove all non-digits
       , regexp_replace(line_str, '[^0-9]', '') as line
       , line_str
       , orig
    from digit_str
   order by line_no
), row_res as (
  select line_no
       , to_number(substr(line, 1, 1) || substr(line, -1, 1)) as row_res
       , line_str
       , orig
    from only_nums
)
select sum(row_res) from row_res
;
```

## Day 2

[You can read the challenge text here](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2).

### Star 1

This challenge is a great example of how great SQL is for data analysis. I noticed pretty fast that we want to get the highest count for each colored block of each line. So we will probably need the `max` function.

Additionally we want to get the counts for each color. Repeated text block scream regex to me. To catch each amount of green blocks in `Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 20 green` e.g. a regex like `([0-9]+) green` will work. Notice how I use the brackets to capture the number.

Another trick to do this in a quick fashion is using `apex_string.grep`. This function returns the beautiful `APEX_T_VARCHAR2` type to which I dedicated <Link to="/blog/ode-to-apex-t-varchar2">a whole blog post</Link>.

We can use this and the regex to capture the numbers:

```sql
with str as (
  select 'Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 20 green' as s
)
select apex_string.grep(s, '([0-9]+) green', 'i', '1') as arr
  from str
;
/*
ARR
__________
[2, 20]
*/
```

More interestingly we can use the `table` operator to query the array. With that we can just ask for the max value. The `table` thing returns the column `column_value` which we first need to convert to a number.

```sql
with str as (
  select 'Game 1: 3 blue, 4 red; 1 red, 2 green, 6 blue; 20 green' as s
)
select (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(s, '([0-9]+) green', 'i', '1') ) ) as max
  from str
;
/*
   MAX
______
    20
*/
```

We can apply that pattern to every color to get the max count for each color:

```sql
select line_no
      , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) green', 'i', '1') ) ) as green
      , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) blue', 'i', '1') ) ) as blue
      , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) red', 'i', '1') ) ) as red
     , line_str
  from aoc_input
 where day = 2
   and key = 'INPUT'
 order by line_no
;
/*
   LINE_NO    GREEN    BLUE    RED LINE
__________ ________ _______ ______ ____________________________________
         1        2      15     12 Game 1: 1 green, 2 blue; 15 bl...
         2        9      19      6 Game 2: 5 green, 2 red, 18 blu...
         3       10       8     16 Game 3: 16 red, 10 green; 12 r...
         4       20       9      1 Game 4: 9 blue, 20 green; 1 re...
         5        4       1     10 Game 5: 3 green, 8 red; 1 blue...
*/
```

Next we can just apply a where clause to filter out all the impossible games and sum the `line_no` to get our result:

```sql
with max_draws as (
  select line_no
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) green', 'i', '1') ) ) as green
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) blue', 'i', '1') ) ) as blue
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) red', 'i', '1') ) ) as red
       , line_str
       --, regexp_substr(line_str, '[0-9]+ green')
    from aoc_input
   where day = 2
     and key = 'INPUT'
   order by line_no
), possible_games as (
  select *
    from max_draws
   where red <= 12
     and green <= 13
     and blue <= 14
)
select sum(line_no)
from possible_games
;
```

### Star 2

Star 2 was no problem at all because of our work for star 1. We only need to multiply the max values for each color and sum the results:

```sql
with max_draws as (
  select line_no
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) green', 'i', '1') ) ) as green
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) blue', 'i', '1') ) ) as blue
       , (select max(to_number(column_value)) from table(apex_string.grep(line_str, '([0-9]+) red', 'i', '1') ) ) as red
       , line_str
    from aoc_input
   where day = 2
     and key = 'INPUT'
   order by line_no
), power as (
  select max_draws.*, green * blue * red as pwr
  from max_draws
)
select sum(pwr) from power
;
```
