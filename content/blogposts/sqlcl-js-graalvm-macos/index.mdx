I needed to use JavaScript capabilities in SQLcl and realized that this does not work anymore with my OpenJDK setup. [Jeff Smith blogged](https://www.thatjeffsmith.com/archive/2022/04/running-javascript-in-oracle-sqlcl-22-1/) about the background details and how he got it working. As it changed a bit, was for Windows, and I am on macOS, I decided to blog my solution. Also, note that I don't want to mess with my main OpenJDK setup, so I used a way to type a command and switch to GraalVM.

## Download GraalVM and extensions

[Download GraalVM from this page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#graalvmjava17). Make sure to select your OS and architecture (ARM64 M macs).

Visit [this page](https://www.oracle.com/downloads/graalvm-downloads.html) and check that you have the correct OS and architecture selected (macOS/aarch64 for M Macs). Then download these three extensions:

- JavaScript Runtime
- Tregex Plugin
- ICU4J Plugin

We also need the ICU4J and Tregex plugins as they are dependencies for the JavaScript plugin.

## Be able to switch GraalVM

- Unzip the GraalVM archive and move it to a location of your choice. I moved it to `/Users/phartenfeller/graalvm/graalvm-jdk-17.0.13+10.1`.
- Edit your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc` file and add the following lines:

```bash
graal-vm() {
  export JAVA_HOME="/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/graalvm-ce-java17-22.1.0/Contents/Home"
  export PATH="/Users/phartenfeller/graalvm/graalvm-jdk-17.0.13+10.1/Contents/Home/bin/":$PATH
}
```

- Run `source ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bashrc` to apply the changes.
- Run `graal-vm` to set the environment variables.
- Run `java --version` and verify that the output contains `Oracle GraalVM`.

## Test if SQLcl works

```bash
sql -nolog

# SQLcl: Release 24.3 Production ...

sql> script
  2  ctx.write("Works\n")
  3* /
# Should error
# JavaScript engine not found.
# GraalVM with Nodejs/Javascript support is required
```

## Install JavaScript capabilities

```bash
cd /Users/phartenfeller/graalvm/graalvm-jdk-17.0.13+10.1/Contents/Home/bin

# icu4j
./gu -L install /Users/phartenfeller/Downloads/icu4j-installable-jdk-17-darwin-aarch64-23.0.6.jar
# regex
./gu -L install /Users/phartenfeller/Downloads/regex-installable-jdk-17-darwin-aarch64-23.0.6.jar
# js
./gu -L install /Users/phartenfeller/Downloads/js-installable-jdk-17-darwin-aarch64-23.0.6.jar
```

## Test if JS works

```bash
sql -nolog

sql> script
  2  ctx.write("Works\n")
  3* /
# Works
```

## Conclusion

Now every time I want to use SQLcl with JavaScript capabilities, I can just run `graal-vm` and my main Java version switches to the GraalVM version that can run JavaScript. This way I can keep my main Java version for other projects and only switch when needed.

By the way. If you want to easily run a local containerized database with APEX set up in minutes, check out my project [uc-local-apex-dev](https://github.com/United-Codes/uc-local-apex-dev). I have also been busy in December with an [Advent Calendar full of 24 short APEX tip videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpg61eZsDU4Z4G67ZwX6K5CQh0HhqyM5Z).
