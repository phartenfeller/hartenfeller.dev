## Whats that?

The type `apex_t_varchar2` itself is not that special. If we open up its declaration we can see that it has a different internal name `wwv_flow_t_varchar2` and is basically just a varchar2 array:

```sql
create or replace type wwv_flow_t_varchar2 as table of varchar2(32767);
```

With arrays you can already do cool stuff but `apex_t_varchar2` gets its superpowers because of the `apex_string` package which is a collection of functions to work with them.

# Storing und accessing values

Imagine a complex PL/SQL process where you need to validate lots of independent rows of user input. Because the process is so complex users often times make mistakes. The task of the app is also to tell the users which input is faulty so they can fix it.

Because the rows are independet to each other it makes sense to not exit at the first error but instead valdate all rows and in the end list all erorrs and even some warnings.

To convenietly store these feedback messages we could use `apex_t_varchar2`. We create one array for the error messages and one for the warnings. Each time we come across of problems with the data we add the message to the corresponding array with `apex_string.push`.

```sql
procedure process_user_input
as
  l_errors apex_t_varchar2 := apex_t_varchar2();
  l_warnings apex_t_varchar2 := apex_t_varchar2();
  -- ...
begin
  for rec in (
    select *
      from user_inputs
     order by line_no asc
  )
  loop
    -- ...
    if user_underage(rec.birthdate) then
      apex_string.push(l_errors, 'Line' || rec.line_no || ': User is too young!');
    end if;

    if not country_code_match(rec.country, rec.phone_number) then
      apex_string.push(l_warnings, 'Line' || rec.line_no || ': Country does not match with phone country code!');
    end if;
    -- ...
  end loop;

  if l_warnings.count > 0 then
    l_warnings_list_html := '<ul><li>' || apex_string.join(l_warnings, '</li><li>') || '</li></ul>';
  end if;

  if l_errors.count > 0 then
    l_status_error := true;
    l_error_list_html := '<ul><li>' || apex_string.join(l_errors, '</li><li>') || '</li></ul>';
  else
    l_status_error := false;
  end if;

  -- ...
end process_user_input;
```
