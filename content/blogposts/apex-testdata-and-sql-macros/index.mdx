## APEX Test data with the Data Generator

Have you ever used the Data Generator feature in Oracle APEX? It is hidden in SQL Workshop > Utilities > Data Generator. It allows you to create data shapes for your tables and, afterward, lets you easily generate test data for them.

Furthermore, it comes with a great set of pre-defined domains like `person.first_name` or `country.name` so that the generated data looks realistic. You can customize the data shapes, create your own ones, or hook up values from your own tables.

Check out [my ~1-min video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0aa90crFt7I) to see the Data Generator in action.

## Using it from SQL

Today, I had a use-case where I did not want to create a blueprint in the APEX UI. Instead, I wanted to generate rows of test data on the fly from SQL.

I looked over the [APEX_DG_DATA_GEN PL/SQL documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/24.2/aeapi/APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.html), which describes the data generator API. Unfortunately, most functions require you to reference a blueprint ID, so you need to create one first. I also found the [GET_EXAMPLE function](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/24.2/aeapi/GET_EXAMPLE-Function.html#GUID-6DD10BBA-BCF7-4826-9953-F33B5F043606), which allows you to pass a domain name and a number of rows and gives you back an `apex_t_varchar2` array with example values of the domain.

This sounded like a promising solution, so I tried to construct a single query that would result in 20 rows of a generated first name, last name, country, etc. This is the resulting SQL, which is enormous and complex:

```sql
with first_names as (
  select rownum as rn, column_value as first_name
    from table(
      APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE (
        p_friendly_name   => 'person.first_name',
        p_rows            => 20 )
      )
), last_names as (
  select rownum as rn, column_value as last_name
    from table(
      APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE (
        p_friendly_name   => 'person.last_name',
        p_rows            => 20 )
      )
), countries as (
  select rownum as rn, column_value as country
    from table(
      APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE (
        p_friendly_name   => 'country.name',
        p_rows            => 20 )
      )
), credit_cards as (
  select rownum as rn, column_value as credit_card
    from table(
      APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE (
        p_friendly_name   => 'credit_card.card_number',
        p_rows            => 20 )
      )
), phone_numbers as (
  select rownum as rn, column_value as phone_number
    from table(
      APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE (
        p_friendly_name   => 'phone.us_phone_number',
        p_rows            => 20 )
      )
)
select fn.first_name,
       ln.last_name,
       ct.country,
       cc.credit_card,
       ph.phone_number
  from first_names fn
  join last_names ln on fn.rn = ln.rn
  join countries ct on ct.rn = ln.rn
  join credit_cards cc on cc.rn = ln.rn
  join phone_numbers ph on ph.rn = ln.rn
;
```

We have to call `APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE` for each domain, convert the returned [apex_t_varchar2 array](https://hartenfeller.dev/blog/ode-to-apex-t-varchar2) to rows, and then join everything together. While it works great, it is not really flexible as adding or changing domains is cumbersome.

## SQL Macros to the rescue

As the query follows a certain pattern, I thought it would be straightforward to dynamically generate the SQL. I could either build a function that returns the SQL, do some ref-cursor magic, or create a pipelined table function that returns the rows. But then I remembered one of the **best new features** of the Oracle Database recently: SQL Macros. Recently meaning that unfortunately the macro I show is only available from Oracle 23ai.

SQL macros allow you to encapsulate complex SQL logic into reusable functions with SQL like performance. One of the best use cases is [parameterized views](https://livesql.oracle.com/ords/livesql/file/tutorial_KQNYERE8ZF07EZMRR6KJ0RNIR.html). I don't want to go into too much detail here; please refer to the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/lnpls/SQL_MACRO-clause.html) if you are interested in the details.

The core of a SQL macro looks like a function where you just return the string of an SQL statement. Notice the return type `clob sql_macro(table)`:

```sql
create or replace function gen_test_data (
  p_parameter in varchar2
) return clob sql_macro(table)
as
  l_sql clob;
begin
  l_sql := q'! select ... !';
  -- do whatever you want to build the SQL

  return l_sql;
end;
```

Filling in the magic, this is now my SQL macro that generates a `with` section, the columns in the `select` and the `from` and `join` clauses from the array of domains you pass:

```sql
create or replace function gen_test_data (
  p_domains in apex_t_varchar2,
  p_rows in number default 20
) return clob sql_macro(table)
as
  l_sql clob;
  l_with_clauses clob;
  l_select_clause clob;
  l_from_clause clob;
begin
  l_select_clause := 'select ';
  l_from_clause := 'from ';

  <<domain_loop>>
  for i in 1..p_domains.count loop
    l_with_clauses := l_with_clauses ||
      case when i > 1 then ', ' else ' ' end ||
      't' || i || ' AS (
          SELECT rownum AS rn, column_value AS ' || replace(p_domains(i), '.', '$') || '
          FROM table(
              APEX_DG_DATA_GEN.GET_EXAMPLE(
                  p_friendly_name => ''' || p_domains(i) || ''',
                  p_rows => ' || p_rows || '
              )
          )
      )';

      l_select_clause := l_select_clause ||
        case when i > 1 then ', ' else ' ' end ||
        't' || i || '.' || replace(p_domains(i), '.', '$');

      l_from_clause := l_from_clause ||
        case when i = 1 then 't' || i
             else ' join t' || i || ' on t1.rn = t' || i || '.rn'
        end;
  end loop domain_loop;

  l_sql := 'with ' || l_with_clauses || ' ' ||
    l_select_clause || ' ' ||
    l_from_clause;

  return l_sql;
end gen_test_data;
```

More interestingly, see how easy it is now to query the data:

```sql
select * from gen_test_data(
  p_domains => apex_t_varchar2(
    'person.first_name', 'person.last_name', 'country.name'
  , 'credit_card.card_number', 'phone.us_phone_number'),
  p_rows => 3
);
/*
PERSON$FIRST_NAME    PERSON$LAST_NAME    COUNTRY$NAME    CREDIT_CARD$CARD_NUMBER    PHONE$US_PHONE_NUMBER
____________________ ___________________ _______________ __________________________ ________________________

*/
```

Let's try another example:

```sql
select * from gen_test_data(
  p_domains => apex_t_varchar2(
    'animal.species', 'element.name', 'plant.species'),
  p_rows => 3
);
/*

ANIMAL$SPECIES    ELEMENT$NAME    PLANT$SPECIES
_________________ _______________ ________________
A.melanoleuca     Molybdenum      speciosa
M.novaeangliae    Mendelevium     insularis
L.rufus           Cerium          asahinae
*/
```

## How do you know which domains are available?

You can query the `APEX_DG_BUILTINS` view, which lists all the available domains and their categories. In APEX 24.2 there are 193 domains of a wide variety.

```sql
select * from APEX_DG_BUILTINS;
```

As I also frequently use my [Alfred extension](https://hartenfeller.dev/blog/apex-alfred-dev-workflow) to look up APEX-specific things. I added support for the list of domains to it. If you are on macOS and also use Alfred, this is probably interesting for you too.

<BlogGif
  filename="alfred-data-generator-domains.gif"
  alt="The user types in apex data generator in the Alfred search bar. The Alfred window shows a list of domains with their friendly names. The user types in city to filter the list and then selects 'school.cities'. The word is typed out in a query editor window and then used with the macro to show results."

## More you can do with SQL Macros

I used a `table` macro (which you use in the `from` section). You can also create `scalar` macros (which you select as columns). Macros also allow you to pass literal tables and lists of columns, making them super flexible.

Andrej Pashchenko blogged about more complex but super powerful macros, which are great examples of their flexibility. I recommend checking them out:
