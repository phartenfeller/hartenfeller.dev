I have the issue that I tend to keep a lot of windows open on my Mac. This issue persists until my next reboot but in some cases I just get overwhelmed by all the mess. Unfortunately there is no built-in feature in Mac OS to minimize all windows at once. But there is a simple way to do it with an AppleScript.

## Create the AppleScript

You can use this AppleScript to minimize all windows. You might get asked for accessibility permissions the first time you run it.

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
	set theProcesses to (every process whose visible is true and name is not "Finder")
	repeat with proc in theProcesses
		tell proc
			set theWindows to every window
			repeat with win in theWindows
				set value of attribute "AXMinimized" of win to true
			end repeat
		end tell
	end repeat
end tell
tell application "Finder" to set collapsed of windows to true
```

As I am an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) user I created a small worflow to execute this via Spotlight. You can download it [here](/misc/Minimize-all.alfredworkflow). Also check out my [Alfred VS Code extension](/blog/alfred-vscode-workflow).

## Other solutions

I stumbled upon [this superuser thread](https://superuser.com/questions/36504/how-to-minimize-all-windows-in-macos) asking for the same thing. The answers point out the expos√© and the `Command+Option+H+M` key combo. The later one unfortunately doesnt work for me as it only hides the windows, without them appearing in the dock as minimized windows.
