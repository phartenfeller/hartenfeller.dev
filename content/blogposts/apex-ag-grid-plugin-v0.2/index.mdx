## The Plug-In

I am working on an APEX plug-in that allows you to use the [AG-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) component in your APEX applications. It offers a spreadsheet-like data editing experience and thus can be used as an alternative to the Interactive Grid.

Take a look at the [demo app](https://apex.oracle.com/pls/apex/r/hartenfeller_dev/ag-grid-plugin-demo) to experience the plug-in in action. The source code of the plug-in is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/phartenfeller/apex-ag-grid-plugin).

## New Features

The following features have been added since the first beta release:

### Checkbox column type

Edit boolean values in a column with a checkbox.

### Reactive HTML column type

Put an HTML template that also allows [APEX template syntax](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/apex/22.2/aexjs/apex.util.html#.applyTemplate). The column acts reactive meaning that after changes to other columns the template is re-evaluated and the HTML is rerendered.

### Revert changes and duplicate row

You can now revert changes on a modified row. You can also duplicate a row to create a new one.

### Define max column width

You can now define a maximum width for a column so you can limit ones which a foreseeable content length.
