We all now that the Universal theme in Oracle Application Express does a great job to make the pages usable on small screens like smartphones and tablets. But in many cases pages do not scale well on big screens like 4k.

The reason for this is that on big screens everything will be wider. But that is not that great [because reading will become more difficult if the lines are too long](https://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability).

The simple solution to this is to [contain the content by adding margin on the left and right side](https://css-tricks.com/optimizing-large-scale-displays/#containment). If you are reading this blog on a big screens you can also see that the text does not use the full horizontal width.

## The Quick Fix

In APEX we can achieve the same with a wrapper region and some media query css.

## A scalable solution

This solution is not great if you want to do it at a large scale. Instead we can create a new page template and limit the width in there. Then we can apply that template to all of the pages.

For that we can create a copy of the Standard Templates in Shared Components > Templates
