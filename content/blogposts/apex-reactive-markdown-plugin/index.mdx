**TL;DR**: I created a plug-in that renders Markdown in APEX and reacts to changes of referenced page items.

## My pain with displaying rich text in APEX

Most of our applications probably lack context of what the app does. To solve this we can create a static content region, change the template and put some HTML in there. Easy but as I am used to Markdown writing a lot `<p>`, `<li>`, or `<b>` tags is a bit tedious.

For my [Practical AI in PL/SQL Made Easy](https://youtube.com/live/k4Vt7AKXCnM) webinar I wanted to display the JSON response of the AI nicely formatted in a region. Additionally the JSON gets generated from an dynamic action without any submits so it needs to update automatically.

At that point I thought "probably possible with native APEX but too difficult". So I decided to put my pain to rest and build a plug-in that solves this.

## How does it work?

It is a region plug-in with three attributes.

### Template

In the template attribute you can define what Markdown template should actually be rendered.

So you can directly write Markdown into the attribute or reference a page item that contains some value. During rendering the plug-in will evaluate all values of the referenced page items.

```
Hello! My name is `:P3050_NAME`. I am **:P3050_AGE** years old. I live in :P3050_CITY.
```

You could also put everything into a text item and just reference it. You can easily build a side-by-side editor with a textarea and the preview.

```
:P3050_TEXT_INPUT
```

  alt="Side by side view. Left a normal APEX textarea with some markdown as source. On the right side, the Markdown gets previewed."
/>

### Reactivity Mode

APEX client-side features work on an event-based system. This means you have to manually add dynamic actions that run on change of item X to update item or region Y. This can be tedious if you have a lot of items that should trigger an update like a manual page filter.

Modern frontend frameworks are reactive (giving the React framework its name). That means you mark a variable and the framework automatically updates everything that depends on it. This is way more convenient.

The plug-in offers three reactivity modes:

- change: the plug-in will update when a referenced page item changes (leave input)
- input: the plug-in will update on every input (while typing)
- off: no reactivity, only initial rendering

This is how it behaves in the input mode:

  alt="When typing in the input field, the markdown preview updates in real-time to reflect the changes."
/>

### Theme

The plug-in uses the GitHub Markdown CSS styles per default. There is a light and dark theme variant. Additionally I built a Universal Theme variant that uses your APEX theme colors. Under the hood it uses the [APEX CSS variables](https://youtu.be/TT6uIz_8Qlk).

## Noteworthy Markdown Features

Next to the standard Markdown features, the plug-in supports:

- Tables (not yet supported by the `APEX_MARKDOWN` package)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting for various languages
- Math formulas
- Alerts

This is the underlying markdown for the above screenshot:

```markdown
#### Code Block Example H4

(remove # before ``` - my blog does not support nested code blocks...)
#```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary
FROM
    employees
WHERE
    salary > 50000;
#```


##### Table Example H5

| Header 1         |   Header 2   |     Header 3 |
| :--------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| Data Row 1A Long |   Data 1B    |      Data 1C |
| Data Row 2A      | Data 2B Long | Long Data 2C |
| Data Row 3A      |   Data 3B    |      Data 3C |

###### Mathematics Example H6

$$ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} $$
