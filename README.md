My personal portfolio and blog.

To run locally execute `yarn insall` and afterwards `yarn start`. The page now runs on https://localhost:8000.

For the blogposts I use the headless cms [strapi](https://strapi.io/), have a look at the `.env.example` file.

Build with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/).
